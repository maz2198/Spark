## Chicago Crimes Analysis: 2014 -2016

The main purpose of this assignment was to choose a large open-source dataset, develop a persona/business case and answer business question using Spark queries taught in class. 

I chose the Chicago Crimes Dataset. This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days. Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. In order to protect the privacy of crime victims, addresses are shown at the block level only and specific locations are not identified. This dataset is available for download from [Chicago City Data Portal](https://www.kaggle.com/spirospolitis/chicago-crimes-20012018-november).

The code is outlined in `ChicagoCrimesIndividual.ipynb` and the business case and answers to the business queries are summarized in `MarangSparkAssignment.pdf`.
