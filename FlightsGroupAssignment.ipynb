    "According to a 2010 report made by the US Federal Aviation Administration, the economic price of domestic flight delays generates yearly costs of USD 32.9 billion to passengers, airlines and other parts of the economy. More than half of that amount comes from the pockets of passengers, as they do not only waste time waiting for their planes to leave, but also in missed connecting flights, money spent not only on food but also sleeping on hotel rooms while they're stranded.\n",
    "\n",
    "The report, focusing on data from the year 2007, estimated that air transportation delays put a a dent of USD 4 billion in the country's gross domestic product in that year. The full report can be found in the following link: \n",

    "29. **LateAircraftDelay** in minutes: Arrival delay at an airport due to the late arrival of the same aircraft at a previous airport. The ripple effect of an earlier delay at downstream airports is referred to as delay propagation"
