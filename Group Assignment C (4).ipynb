    "According to a 2010 report made by the US Federal Aviation Administration, the economic price of domestic flight delays entails a yearly cost of 32.9 billion dollars to passengers, airlines and other parts of the economy. More than half of that amount comes from passengers' pockets, as they do not only waste time waiting for their planes to leave, but also miss connecting flights, spend money on food and have to sleep on hotel rooms while they're stranded.\n",

    "The report, focusing on data from year 2007, estimated that air transportation delays put a 4 billion dollar dent in the country's gross domestic product that year. Full report can be found \n",

Examples of occurrences that may determine carrier delay are: aircraft cleaning, aircraft damage, awaiting the arrival of connecting passengers or crew, baggage, bird strike, cargo loading, catering, computer, outage-carrier equipment, crew legality (pilot or attendant rest), damage by hazardous goods, engineering inspection, fueling, handling disabled passengers, late crew, lavatory servicing, maintenance, oversales, potable water servicing, removal of unruly passenger, slow boarding or seating, stowing carry-on baggage, weight and balance delays.\n",
    "26. **WeatherDelay** in minutes: Weather delay is caused by extreme or hazardous weather conditions that are forecasted or manifest themselves on point of departure, enroute, or on point of arrival.\n",
    "27. **NASDelay** in minutes: Delay that is within the control of the National Airspace System (NAS) may include: non-extreme weather conditions, airport operations, heavy traffic volume, air traffic control, etc.\n",
    "28. **SecurityDelay** in minutes: Security delay is caused by evacuation of a terminal or concourse, re-boarding of aircraft because of security breach, inoperative screening equipment and/or long lines in excess of 29 minutes at screening areas.\n",
    "29. **LateAircraftDelay** in minutes: Arrival delay at an airport due to the late arrival of the same aircraft at a previous airport. The ripple effect of an earlier delay at downstream airports is referred to as delay propagation"
